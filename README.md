EXECUTABLE PATH
---------------

QUICK START
-----------

This is a console application. 
User interaction occurs through commands entered on the command line.


INPUT RULES
-----------

*The sign '+' is not perceived by the program.
*The sign '-' must be written before the number itself without a space.

1) Natural numbers: 

*A sequence of numbers without spaces and signs.
*In the subtraction and division sections, the first number must be greater than the second.
*In sections, the largest common divisor and the smallest common multiple of a number must not be zero.
*The divisor must not be zero.
*If you ignore this rule, the program will ask you to enter the number again.

2) Integer:

*The divisor must not be zero.
*A number sign appears in this section. It is indicated first without a space.
*In the division sections, the first number must be greater than the second.

3) Rational numbers: 

*Input - ((-)numerator/denominator). 
*If the numerator is negative, then the sign '-'.
*If the denominator is zero, the program will ask for the number again.

4) Polynomials:

*Input - Coefficients are introduced - rational numbers (you need to enter them according to the rule described for rational numbers) 
and are separated by one space.
*After the last coefficient, you do not need to put a space.
*The first coefficient will be at the oldest degree.
